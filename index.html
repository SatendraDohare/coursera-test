                    <div id="d1">Chicken</div>
                    <p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species
                        such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeast Asia. Rooster and cock are
                        terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a
                        capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep
                        chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally they
                        were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are
                        broilers and for eggs are layers.

               <div  id="d2">Beef</div> 
                <p>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle (Bos taurus).
                    In prehistoric times, humankind hunted aurochs and later domesticated them. Since that time, numerous breeds
                    of cattle have been bred specifically for the quality or quantity of their meat. Today, beef is the third
                    most widely consumed meat in the world, after pork and poultry. As of 2018, the United States, Brazil, and
                    China were the largest producers of beef.

                         <p>sushi, a staple rice dish of Japanese cuisine, consisting of cooked rice flavoured with vinegar and a variety
                             of vegetable, egg, or raw seafood garnishes and served cold. Restaurants specializing in sushi abound in
                             Japan, where subtleties of preparation find a discriminating clientele, and the dish has gained popularity
                             in the United States and elsewhere (see also sashimi).</p>
